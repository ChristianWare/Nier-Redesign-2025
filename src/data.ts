      "Nier Transportation provided the best, outstanding quality of service for at least 20-25 family members for memorial services for my dear father. We required multiple stops, and wait times, and they were first of all affordable, on time, professional, and extremely kind. I would 1000% recommend using them for any transportation needs for personal and business purposes.",

      "Barry provides great reliable service in comfortable luxury. I travel out 1-2 times/month and I can schedule ahead. Barry will always verify the day before in the event anything changes (which it can with my job). I feel safer having someone I know pick me up sometimes at 4a. Thank you Barry!",

      "We have used this car service 4 times in the last few months. Booking a pick-up/drop-off time is very easy and seamless. Barry, the owner is very professional, friendly, and prompt as was one of his other drivers. We have flown in and out of Phoenix all 4 times with our dog and his kennel and Barry was very attentive to ensuring our dog (while in his kennel) was comfortable and safe before we left.Pricing is competitive but the service is better and good value for what you get. Cars are very roomy and spotless. Highly recommend this car service.",

      "We used Nier Transportation to start and end our European vacation. It was the BEST decision! Our driver was professional, friendly, and timely. We also felt as though we were riding in luxury, the vehicle was new, fresh, and comfortable! An extra thanks for being at the airport waiting for us when we arrived back home at 1:30 a.m.!",

      "I just started utilizing Nier Transportation a couple of months ago and have never used a driving service before. I was surprised to see how easy it was to schedule and use as I wasn't sure how it would work in relation to price timeliness, and reliability. I travel almost weekly and Barry, the owner made it very simple by asking for my flight itinerary, and pick-up times. I have used his service a few times so far and have had numerous changes to my plans and he has come through every time. He even made a special trip to pick up a backpack for my daughter when I was in Hawaii so when we returned, we wouldn't have to make a special trip. Vehicles are nice and clean, and Barry is a good man. His pricing is competitive and you get great value with all the things I stated above. Highly Recommended",
